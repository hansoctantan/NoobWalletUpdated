# NoobWalletUpdated
This is updated version of this project https://github.com/CryptoKass/NoobChain-Tutorial-Part-2/tree/master/src/noobchain

I tried to add miners wallet where a new NoobCoin will be added when a block is mined.

Please comment if I do the right/wrong codings. I am new to blockchain and I tried to execute some functions done in bitcoin.
